Ofront+ is a tool that translates Oberon-2 programs into semantically equivalent C programs. Full error analysis is performed on the Oberon input program and in case of no errors up to three files are generated as output.

Ofront+ does not invoke the C compiler or linkage editor. This may be done in separate shell scripts or make files and is inherently dependent on the C compiler and linkage editor being used.

Although normally not read by the user, the C code generated by Ofront+ is kept as readable as possible, nicely formatted, should not produce any C compiler error messages or warnings and is tuned for efficient execution. In fact, an Oberon program translated by Ofront+ can be expected to execute as fast and read as well as an equivalent hand-coded C program.

Ofront+ is based on Ofront by Software Templ OEG. Here are two versions:

1. Ofront+ for Windows & Linux command line

2. Ofront+ for BlackBox Component Builder (runs as a subsystem)

Now you can download a beta version at https://github.com/Oleg-N-Cher/OfrontPlus
