OfrontTM 1.2.3 for Windows (under BlackBox 1.6rc6)
==================================================

It's my own fork of Ofront for Windows/BlackBox.

Installation
------------

There are two ways to install.

1. Download and unpack BB-XDev, Ofront is present there as a subsystem.

   https://github.com/Oleg-N-Cher/BB-XDev/

2. Unpack the folder "Ofront" from the distribution archive to BlackBox root.
   Unpack the folder "Nav" from "Ofront/Arch/Ofront for Windows/ofrontBB1.4.zip" to BlackBox root.
   Open "Ofront/Docu/Rebuild-Ofront.odc" and press the commander to rebuild the Ofront.


Differences from the original ver. from Josef Templ, Software Templ OG
======================================================================

- Added support for character '_' in identifiers. Use this feature with caution, and only when absolutely necessary (for WinApi constants, etc). Remember, this character is not present in the standards of Oberon/Oberon-2.

- Added very basic support for unsigned data types - SYSTEM.SHORTCARD, SYSTEM.CARDINAL, SYSTEM.LONGCARD. Still are problems: assignments to UType if value > MAX(corresponding SType), MIN/MAX(UType), export/import UTypes.

- Set Ofront default option 'allow interface change' to On. Set object files (*.h, *.c, *.sym) directory to 'Ofront/Obj'.

- You can use F11 (in BlackBox) to translate a source through Ofront.
